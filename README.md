# Overview

This is a small project created using Vue3 compositional api, Typescript, and vite. I use yarn for this project

# Quickstart

1. Download the files using git clone 
2. Go into cats directory and run the following commands:
   A. yarn - to install all dependencies. (If you have no yarn installed you need to install it first 'npm install --global yarn')
   B. yarn dev - to run the project
   C. base on the ouput url use that to view the page. (ex. 'http://localhost:5173', port may vary)

# Linting - uses eslint
1. yarn lint   # This will show you any linting errors for typescript if any
2. yarn lint-fix # Will automatically fix all fixable linting problems
